This repository demonstrates a subtle Python bug involving a conditional statement that masks a potential ZeroDivisionError. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` avoids raising a ZeroDivisionError when the first argument is 0, even if the second argument is non-zero. This behavior can be unexpected and difficult to track down during debugging. The solution highlights a better approach to handling potential division by zero, ensuring robustness and maintainability.
